Description: A transcriptomic model for predicting 
  non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) consensus subtypes. 
  This approach utilizes a single-sample classifier based on 
  the Pearson nearest-centroid method, which evaluates the correlation 
  between the transcriptomic profile of an individual sample and 
  the representative profiles of the four NMIBC consensus clusters (CMC1-4) 
  as outlined in Liu et al (to be published).
